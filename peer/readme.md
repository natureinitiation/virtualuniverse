Launch the site in two windows of one browser, exchange the windows passwords via Start Node and Connect to Node. In both windows, click on the screen several times to create objects. Then in both windows, click Drop to switch to Pick Up mode and click on the objects that appear. The counters will show that objects are returned in one case, and added in the other. And this is without a server via WebSocket. I am currently working on making this possible remotely, not only within one browser, one operating system or home network, but the entire Internet. To do this, it is necessary to find new standard ways for the legal interaction of decentralized nodes.
