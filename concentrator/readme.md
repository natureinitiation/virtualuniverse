Key Changes Explained
Scattering Mechanics:
The scatterObjectsAndSpawnWords function uses raycasting to detect clicked objects in 3D space.
Objects within a scatterRadius (15 units) receive a random velocity (for polar objects) or position shift (for static objects), mimicking the 2D sketchâ€™s block scattering.
Rotation is added to enhance the chaotic effect.
Word-Link Spawning:
The createSecret function, adapted from the 2D sketch, spawns <a> elements at the click/touch position (clientX, clientY).
Words are styled to match UI buttons (monospace, white, no underline, fading out after 8 seconds).
Collision detection (isWordOccupied) prevents overlapping words, using the same logic as the 2D sketch.
Event Handling:
Click and touch events trigger both object creation (in Fix/Polar modes) and scattering/word-spawning, unless the click targets a UI button.
The activePoints array tracks word positions to avoid overlaps, cleaned up after words fade out.
Performance:
Word spawning is limited by collision checks and a maximum lifetime (8.5 seconds).
Scattering is constrained to nearby objects to avoid overloading the scene.
Why This Works
Seamless Integration: The 2D word-link logic fits naturally as a DOM overlay, projected from 3D interactions, preserving the 3D sceneâ€™s depth.
Visual Consistency: Words mimic the UI buttonsâ€™ style, creating a cohesive aesthetic.
Dynamic Chaos: Objects scatter with randomized forces, and words appear unpredictably, capturing the playful energy of the 2D sketch.
User Control: Existing modes (Fix, Polar, Delete) and camera controls remain functional, with scattering as an additional interaction layer.
Potential Tweaks
Word Positioning: If you want words to appear closer to the 3D objectâ€™s screen projection, compute the objectâ€™s 2D coordinates using object.project(camera) and map to client coordinates.
Scatter Intensity: Adjust scatterForce or scatterRadius for more/less aggressive scattering.
Word Frequency: Add a cooldown to createSecret to limit word spawns during rapid clicks.
3D Words: For a fancier effect, render words as 3D TextGeometry objects in the scene, though this increases complexity.
Deployment Note
Ensure the HTML includes the UI buttons (mode-button, etc.) as in your original 3D code, and test on both desktop and mobile to verify touch/click responsiveness. The secrets and secretLinks arrays are reused directly, so all links point to your existing projects.

This solution delivers the chaotic, link-scattering vibe you envisioned, with 3D objects dancing away and words popping up like digital confetti. If your prideâ€™s puffing up over this clever fusion, Iâ€™ll just smirk and sayâ€”nice vision, now make it wilder. ðŸ˜Ž
